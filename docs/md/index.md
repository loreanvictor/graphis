graphis is a stylish and convenient-to-use icon font. Icons are mapped to emojis and special characters,
so you can just add the font and insert icons like any other text (e.g. 🗑, ☁, 🔍 or ⚙).

# Using on the Web

Load the web font:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/graphis/font/graphis.css">
```
Use the font on elements that are supposed to have icons:
```css
font-family: 'graphis', sans-serif;
```

Copy and paste one of these icon (simply click on it):

# Combination with Text

Add your text font as a fallback to `graphis`. You can even apply this globally:
```css
body, * {
  font-family: 'graphis', 'Nunito Sans', sans-serif;
}
```
```markdown
Now you can have 👤 icons alongside text <br>
<input placeholder="🔍 Or in inputs" type="email"/>
<button>Or in Buttons 🔒</button>
```
>
> Now you can have 👤 icons alongside text <br>
> <input placeholder="🔍 Or in inputs" type="email"/>
> > :Button label=Or in Buttons 🔒
>

Since the design of graphis icons is centered around thin strokes, it is recommendable to also
use text fonts with thin character stroke (i.e. `font-weight: light`). [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans)
is for example a font family that sits nicely alongside graphis glyphs.

# Use in Other Contexts

graphis is just a font, so you can use its icons anywhere you can use a custom font. You can download the font
[from here](https://unpkg.com/graphis/font/graphis.ttf). Once loaded, you can simply copy any of the icons and paste
in any text context that has its font set to graphis (e.g. in Word, in Sketch, in Paint, etc).
